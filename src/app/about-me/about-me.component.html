                    Hey, nice to meet you!

                    I am Silvio, a German-speaking Frontend Developer near Munich with experience in building web apps
                    with
                    JavaScript & Angular. I have written projects alone or in teams, based on clean
                    code principles. You're welcome to visit my public portfolio.

                I am fascinated by the variety of possibilities in programming. Building projects from scratch and the
                sense of achievement after finishing them are one of my favorite aspects. I am looking for an opportunity to prove my skills as a junior frontend developer.

                I am very glad to have found my place in the world of programming, now I am seeking a place in a great team.
                My goal is to constantly learn and grow. I am highly motivated and excited to master new challenges and to learn from them every day.
